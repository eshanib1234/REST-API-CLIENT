DESCRIPTION:In this project, I developed a Java-based weather forecast application using Visual Studio Code as the development tool. The application fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities by making API calls to the WeatherAPI.com service.It displays important weather details such as temperature, condition, and humidity for cities like London, New York, Tokyo, and Paris.
